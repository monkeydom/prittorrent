Written on EH 2010 in Munich.

Purpose
-------

Your Podcast is too popular for your web server? Your audience has
Podcast clients that support downloading via BitTorent, e.g. Miro?

servtorrent ensures that there's always a seeder by uploading
transparently from any HTTP location that supports Range requests.


Installation
------------

1. Install Erlang

2. Activate and update submodules
	 * git submodule init
	 * git submodule update

Running
-------

1. Copy seeds.example.xml to seeds.xml and customize (the data directory is setup for 
   this, put the torrents in data/torrents and the files in data/files - you can 
   use absolute paths in the seeds.xml file as well and use your own structure).
   When dealing with multi file torrents make sure the data part points inside
   and not at the first directory.

2. Make sure the port specified in servtorrent.app is reachable from
   the Internet (servtorrent will not use peer info from tracker
   responses).

3. Compile and run by issuing: ./start.sh


TODO
----

* Super-seeding
* Slot queues
* PEX
* DHT support
* Support Chaos Bay web-seeding
